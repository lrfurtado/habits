# Follow-up Questions

## Schedule & Workflow
1. Do you want fixed-time activities only, or also flexible blocks that can shift automatically?
2. Should overlapping activities be allowed or always prevented?
3. Do you prefer planning one day at a time, or using reusable templates?
4. What is your typical day start/end window?

## Pomodoro Preferences
5. What default focus/break lengths do you want (e.g., 25/5, 50/10)?
6. Should pomodoro settings be global or customizable per activity?
7. Do you want long breaks after a certain number of focus sessions?

## Reminder Behavior
8. How many pre-start reminders should be supported by default?
9. If you do not acknowledge, should reminders continue indefinitely or stop after a threshold?
10. What escalation pattern feels acceptable (frequency/volume/message tone)?
11. Should reminders be suppressed while you are in another active activity?

## Voice Alerts
12. Do you want short alerts only, or spoken contextual messages?
13. Should different events use different voices or same voice with different phrasing?
14. Any quiet hours or do-not-disturb periods to enforce automatically?

## macOS Notifications
15. Should notifications mirror every voice alert, or only critical events?
16. Do you need actionable notification buttons (e.g., Snooze, Ack) if supported?
17. Is repeated macOS renotification required until acknowledgement?

## Acknowledgement Model
18. Should start/end acknowledgement be mandatory or optional per activity?
19. What quick actions should exist besides Ack (snooze, skip, defer, extend)?
20. When snoozing, should schedule times shift automatically?

## TUI Experience
21. What matters most on the main dashboard (timer, progress, next tasks, overdue count)?
22. Do you prefer vim-like keybindings, simple arrows, or configurable keys?
23. Should the interface be minimal monochrome or color-coded status-heavy?

## Data, History, and Reporting
24. How long should history be retained?
25. Which metrics matter most: completion rate, deep-focus minutes, missed acknowledgements, or interruptions?
26. Do you want CSV/JSON export from day/weekly summaries?

## Reliability & Edge Cases
27. On app restart, should timers resume from wall clock time or from paused state?
28. How should missed activities be handled (auto-skip, reschedule, prompt)?
29. Should timezone changes be considered for travel or remote work?

## Future Scope
30. Do you eventually want calendar integration (Apple/Google), or keep it standalone?
31. Any interest in habit streak tracking beyond daily schedule adherence?
32. Would you want optional ambient sounds or focus music triggers later?
